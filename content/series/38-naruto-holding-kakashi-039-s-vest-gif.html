    <p>I love so much this pic bc of naruto holding on kakashi&#039;s vest to feel safer. Not once was naruto hit, but the same could not be said for kakashi. On the boat, kakashi holds a red jade stone in his hand, which is a parting gift from terumi mei. Having that said, it seems like this is the first time kakashi has worn this uniform after being in naruto world for so long. He didn&#039;t notice when he had buried his tears in kakashi&#039;s jounin vest, or how he ended up desperately holding onto the man in what could have been a hug.</p>
